# 2D Narrative Platformer – COMP2150 Assignment 1

A Unity-based 2D platformer built using the Unity 2D Game Kit (2019.4.19f1) as part of the COMP2150 Level Design assignment at Macquarie University. This project explores narrative-driven level progression, player learning, and environment design using prebuilt and custom prefabs.

## About the Game

This game consists of three narrative levels, each designed to teach and challenge players through thoughtful layout, pacing, and thematic progression. Using Unity’s 2D Game Kit and additional prefabs, the platformer emphasizes indirect learning, player emotion, and spatial storytelling.

- **Level 1:** Introduces core mechanics like jumping, enemy encounters, and hazards
- **Level 2:** Expands on player choice through nonlinear paths and layered difficulty
- **Level 3:** Climactic design focused on skill mastery, risk-reward, and visual contrast

## Technologies Used

- **Game Engine:** Unity (v2019.4.19f1)
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
- **Scripting:** C# (Minimal scripting using Game Kit triggers)
- **Design Tools:** Unity Tilemap Editor
- **Collaboration Tools:** iLearn, Google Drive

## My Role

I was responsible for all aspects of level design, with a focus on:

- **Environment Design: Built all three levels from scratch using prefabs, hazards, and layered tilemaps.
- **Narrative Progression: Designed thematic and emotional flow across each level.
- **Visual Storytelling: Used lighting, tiles, and skyboxes to reinforce level mood and difficulty.
- **Player Learning: Applied indirect teaching methods (e.g. layout cues, checkpoints) to guide players
- **Playtesting & Feedback: Iterated based on personal testing and peer feedback

---

## Challenges Faced

- **Prefab Limitations: Navigated restrictions of the prebuilt 2D Game Kit while building unique layouts
- **Balancing Difficulty: Ensured each level was learnable without losing engagement
- **Workflow Hiccups: Faced Unity versioning and prefab import errors when switching machines
- **Narrative Cohesion: Adjusted visual tone and level pacing to feel like a consistent and cohesive narrative arc.

## Key Learnings

- **Level Design Principles: Deepened understanding of layout, pacing, and difficulty curves
- **Narrative Integration: Learned to embed emotion and story into spatial design
- **Unity Tilemaps: Gained confidence with layering, collision maps, and decorative tiles
- **Iterative Testing: Embraced feedback cycles to refine layouts and learning flow
